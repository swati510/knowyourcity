					<h3>ABOUT</h3>
					
						<p>Jaipur Airport or Jaipur International Airport (IATA: JAI; OACI: VIJP), is the international airport of Jaipur, the capital city of the state of Rajasthan. Located in the suburb of Sanganer, about 13 km from Jaipur city centre, JAI Airport is considered one of the best airports in India. The city of Jaipur is also called the Pink City and it is because every building within the historic centre is painted with the terracotta colour (pink). Jaipur is definetely one of the main spots for discovering the history and the culture of the region.

						<h3>Must-see attractions:</h3>
						<p>
						A good way to start your trip to Jaipur or also called Pink city it to visit all these astonishing palaces and forts made with red sandstone and marble. Another way of enjoying a trip day is to go to Chokhi Dhani, an ethnic village resort that celebrates rich Rajasthani culture with folk music, magic shows, camel rides and acrobatics on a bamboo tree. End the day with delicious Jaipuri food at the Royal Rajasthani dining hall, where guests enjoy a meal alongside colorful cultural performances.

                                               The Indian state of Rajasthan is a land full of historical forts and palaces, many of them following the ancient Maru-Gurjara architecture. One of the most famous palaces is the Hawa Mahal palace, also called “Palace of Winds” in the Pink city, Jaipur, just next to the City palace. It is believed that it was made for the royal ladies to observe the everyday life in the streets without being seen under the obligation to covering their face, and that’s why it became to be named the Palace of Winds. 

                                   
                                            Amber Fort, with its lake and its famous Sheesh Mahal is another must-see attraction in Jaipur. The mahal is beautiful with many mirrors used over the walls. While you are in Amber Fort don’t miss the opportunity to try an elephant ride.
